Developing a Text Classification Model for Identifying Suicidal  Ideation using Natural Language Processing Techniques (Machine Learning and Deep Learning) 

Suicide has become a serious social health issue in the modern society. Suicidal intent is peopleâ€™s thoughts about committing suicide. The suicide of a person is a tragedy that deeply affects families, communities, and countries. According to the standardized rate of suicides per number of inhabitants worldwide, in 2022 there has been approximately 903,450 suicides and 18,069,000 unconsummated suicides, affecting people of all ages, countries, races, beliefs, social status, economic status, sex, etc. Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that can affect productivity in daily activities and might lead to suicidal thoughts or attempts. That means depression and suicide are related to each other. So, the aim of this project is to detect suicidal intent through depression detection by creating ML and DL models. Two proposed systems are developed for detecting suicidal intent from textual data. Proposed System 1 employs ML and DL approaches with features such as Bag-of-Words (unigram), TF-IDF, and bigram representations. Four ML classifiers (SVM, NB, LR, and RF) and four DL classifiers (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN, and BERT) have been utilized. The evaluation of Proposed System 1 achieves accuracies of 82%, 87%, 77%, 73%, 71%, and 94% for the Reddit, Life_Corpus, CEASE, SWMH, SDCNL, and SDD datasets, respectively. Proposed System 2 incorporates a hybrid approach, combining LSTM, SVM, and the VADER Lexicon. The evaluation of Proposed System 2 yields accuracies of 97.4%, 97.14%, 99.2%, 91.5%, 94.4%, and 93.7% for the Reddit, Life_Corpus, CEASE, SWMH, SDCNL, and SDD datasets, respectively. Comparing the proposed systems with existing works, it is found that they outperform previous research works for the Reddit, Life_Corpus, CEASE, and SWMH datasets, achieving accuracy scores of 97.4%, 97.14%, 99.2%, and 91.5% respectively. Although the proposed model achieves promising results for the SDCNL and SDD datasets with accuracy scores of 94.4% and 94%, further research is needed to surpass the results of previous works.
