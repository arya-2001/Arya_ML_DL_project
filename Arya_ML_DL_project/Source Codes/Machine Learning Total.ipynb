All this occurred over the space of decades.\\n\\nOnce I fucked up bad with alcohol and methadone. I ended up in the ICU. The doctor told me that a large number of bipolar people have addiction problems.\\n\\nNow I take my meds exactly as prescribed and the only other drug I use is marijuana, which is not a problem. \\n\\nAre there others of you that have had any similar problems?   \n","2  Wanted to share some revelations I just had tonight about depression...for the first time in over a year I have hope that things can get better. Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.    \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I feel deader than dead. I find that I don't have real \"wants\" anymore. There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I'm pretty sure my friends suicidal what do I do?

Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.</td>\n","      <td>self.depression</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>I feel deader than dead. I find that I don't have real \"wants\" anymore. There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive.

He's always saying really self hating stuff all the time like \"I'm just a little emo prick\" or \"I'm such a depressed little bitch\" Idk what to do.Help.</td>\n","      <td>self.SuicideWatch</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-a55b661f-003e-44af-a738-af18462feb05')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-a55b661f-003e-44af-a738-af18462feb05 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

I earned a college degree at the age of 18, and I’ve worked for UNC, one of the most prestigious public universities in the United States. I have my own apartment at the age of 20, and I have a loving family and a puppy who keeps me company. I am also supposed to be a good Christian girl, and I used to attend the local Coptic church regularly.\\n\\nBeyond my sunny exterior, like I said earlier, I only have dread. I have hated the fact that I have these mean voices in my head telling me that no one truly cares about me. I have hated the fact that I was so insecure about my weight, and have tried to starve myself to stay skinny: if I ate, I would try anything in my power to regurgitate the food that I ate. I have hated the fact that I have stopped attending classes at UNC, going to church, going to therapy, and going to work like I used to. \\n\\nAll I can bear to do now is to sell my own body for work, and drink to ease the pain. The reason why? That’s the only way I have known to ever feel loved. I was raped since the age of 16 until just recently, and every single day I subconsciously have felt that if no one loves how I look or calls me beautiful that I am worthless. \\n\\nYou may ask why I cannot go to my parents or  anybody from my church to ask for help. The thing is, I feel as if I don’t deserve their help. My parents did not choose to have a daughter like me who has went through so much. People from my church are good people while I am a wretched human being who has done so many horrible things. Besides, I am sure they know that I am not like them. I do all sorts of evil sins, so I would definitely be far from being a good child of God. \\n\\nI am tormented daily. In the morning, by my lack of desire to get up and be productive. At night, by my consistent nightmares. It is all just torture. If I can disappear from existence and not have to experience the pain of death, I would have done it. Right now, I am just trying to decide if disappearing from existence is worth experiencing the pain of death.    \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Guided Meditation Disclaimer:  I am in no way saying meditation should be the sole method of treating bipolar disorder.  I wouldn't be stable enough to meditate without my meds.  Just sharing an experience.\\n\\nI attended my first guided meditation session today and found it really helpful.  My mind has been racing for days.  Just random thoughts pushing out other random thoughts.  25 minutes in a dimly-lit room listening to the soothing voice of someone guiding images was nice.  \\n\\nMy mind wandered as she read, but she instructed me to acknowledge the thoughts and gently push them away.  PTSD tells me not to close my eyes in the room with a stranger; bipolar disorder tells me I can't sit still (mentally or physically) long enough to get through a guided meditation.  But get through it I did, and it was very helpful.  It was conducted in a little shop in our downtown area and only cost $5.  If you're interested in meditation, it might be something to check out in your area.\\n\\nJust my experience.    \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Effexor day 1 is going badly Good news!

I earned a college degree at the age of 18, and I’ve worked for UNC, one of the most prestigious public universities in the United States. I have my own apartment at the age of 20, and I have a loving family and a puppy who keeps me company. I am also supposed to be a good Christian girl, and I used to attend the local Coptic church regularly.\\n\\nBeyond my sunny exterior, like I said earlier, I only have dread. I have hated the fact that I have these mean voices in my head telling me that no one truly cares about me. I have hated the fact that I was so insecure about my weight, and have tried to starve myself to stay skinny: if I ate, I would try anything in my power to regurgitate the food that I ate. I have hated the fact that I have stopped attending classes at UNC, going to church, going to therapy, and going to work like I used to. \\n\\nAll I can bear to do now is to sell my own body for work, and drink to ease the pain. The reason why? That’s the only way I have known to ever feel loved. I was raped since the age of 16 until just recently, and every single day I subconsciously have felt that if no one loves how I look or calls me beautiful that I am worthless. \\n\\nYou may ask why I cannot go to my parents or  anybody from my church to ask for help. The thing is, I feel as if I don’t deserve their help. My parents did not choose to have a daughter like me who has went through so much. People from my church are good people while I am a wretched human being who has done so many horrible things. Besides, I am sure they know that I am not like them. I do all sorts of evil sins, so I would definitely be far from being a good child of God. \\n\\nI am tormented daily. In the morning, by my lack of desire to get up and be productive. At night, by my consistent nightmares. It is all just torture. If I can disappear from existence and not have to experience the pain of death, I would have done it. Right now, I am just trying to decide if disappearing from existence is worth experiencing the pain of death.</td>\n","      <td>self.SuicideWatch</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Guided Meditation Disclaimer:  I am in no way saying meditation should be the sole method of treating bipolar disorder.  I wouldn't be stable enough to meditate without my meds.  Just sharing an experience.\\n\\nI attended my first guided meditation session today and found it really helpful.  My mind has been racing for days.  Just random thoughts pushing out other random thoughts.  25 minutes in a dimly-lit room listening to the soothing voice of someone guiding images was nice.  \\n\\nMy mind wandered as she read, but she instructed me to acknowledge the thoughts and gently push them away.  PTSD tells me not to close my eyes in the room with a stranger; bipolar disorder tells me I can't sit still (mentally or physically) long enough to get through a guided meditation.  But get through it I did, and it was very helpful.  It was conducted in a little shop in our downtown area and only cost $5.

neglectful father. I have no love for either of them. I see all of these people with happy families that look out for each other and are kind to one another and I wish for the same thing. I want a child that will love me and that I'll love and give everything I possibly can to. I want to give them what I couldn't have and never will. I know that I can't right now because I won't be able to financially support them and I don't want them to be anywhere near my mother. But it's always on my mind.    \n","18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I wish friendships never ended... I am currently a senior in high school, but my story starts back in 6th grade.  So, I definitely feel like I need to move on, but I’m not very good with the whole change thing.  \\n\\nAnyways, in 6th grade, I met this girl who I had always kind of known through another friend, but we had just never really talked to each other.  My 6th grade class had about 20 boys and 10 girls, so all the girls pretty much became friends.  This girl lived in my neighborhood, which was great because that meant we could walk or ride our bikes to each other’s houses pretty much everyday.  \\n\\nIt didn’t take very long for us to become best friends.  We did just about everything together, even if it was just sit around on our iPods in the same room.  \\n\\nWe do not live in a very big town, so things got pretty boring being too young to drive places.  Luckily, our neighborhood is not too far from downtown, so we would occasionally ride our bikes downtown to get ice cream and hang out.  During the summers, just about every other night we were spending the night at each other’s houses, watching movies and having fun together.\\n\\nEventually, we made it to our freshman year of high school, and we were still best friends.  Little did I know that meant our friendship was quickly coming to an end...\\n\\nDuring our first semester of freshman year, we had all of the same classes except for one class at the very end of the day.  So that made me very happy because I was terrified of going to high school.  Having my best friend beside me made it a lot less scary because I knew I had someone there for me.  \\n\\nAfter the first semester of freshman year, she decided that she didn’t want to attend public school anymore.  So she decided to give homeschooling a try.  We would still hang out after I got home from school, but things just didn’t feel the same between us anymore.\\n\\nThen after her one semester of homeschooling, she decided it wasn’t her cup of tea and enrolled back into school.  Except she decided to go to a private school instead of our public school.  \\n\\nI still hadn’t really picked up on the fact that she was trying to leave me, so I would occasionally text her trying to start a conversation.  Because in my mind, she was still my best friend, and even though I didn’t see her everyday, I still wanted to talk to her.  Over time she slowly started texting me less and less, and I just eventually gave up.  \\n\\nAt her new school, she made new friends and didn’t want me anymore.  At the time, I just told myself “oh, she’s just busy with school or something” because I didn’t want to admit to myself that we weren’t friends anymore.  \\n\\nLater, I ran in to her around town a couple times, and tried to make plans to meet up with her (at this point we were juniors in high school and we both have our drivers license).  The first time, I went in to a restaurant and she happened to be working there.  She came out and gave me a hug, and said that we should hang out sometime.  So, I asked her when she got off and she told me.  Then I told her to text me when she got home, so I could come over for a little while to hang out with her.  After she got off she did text me, but she said that something came up and she had to go help her brother.  Looking back now, I realize that she didn’t really mean that she wanted to hang out with me, and she made up an excuse to get out of it.  The second time I ran into her, she gave me that fake “oh, we should catch up sometime!”  So I texted her later basically that I missed her, and I wanted to hang out with her.  This conversation ended up to me finally figuring out that when she switched schools, it was because she was tired of me (and her other friends) and wanted to make new friends.  \\n\\nI know it’s ridiculous of me to still be hung up on this one friend for so long now.  I just can’t help it, I’m not a fan of change and I like keeping my friend groups small.  All the time I spent with her, shaped so much of who I am today.  It’s heartbreaking knowing that she decided she was done being my friend, and that it didn’t take her very long to replace me.  A couple years later, and I still haven’t really found a replacement for her...\\n\\n   \n","24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                A terrible friend I have a crazy story to tell and would like some people to tell me what they think happened.   \\n\\nI'm a 37 year old male.  I had a best friend who I have known since Kindergarten.  We grew up at each other's house, have been pretty much inseparable our whole lives.  We live in a really small town and we have continued to be really close over the years.  I have quite a few friends and he does not. As we have gotten older, we only hung out a few times a year but would still text almost every day the last couple of years.  We talk about everything.  We have both been single for a LONG time and jist as recent as this Summer we always talked about when we would meet someone. He has never had many relationships from the opposite sex or guy friends.  \\n\\nFast foward to yesterday.  I find out he has been dating someone for two years, had a wedding over the weekend and closed on a house in another city.  WTF?!?  Why would someone do that?  I don't care about not getting a invite to the wedding as I'm not a fan of them but how can you hang out with a friend for the last 2 years and talk about hoping to meet someone and you have a GF the whole time?!?   The weird part is he still texts me to this day asking me \"If I saw the game last night\" etc.. while he is married, living in a new house and doesn't say anything.  \\n\\nObviously some will say he wasn't that great of a friend to begin with and probably so.  That still doesn't explain why for 2 years he didn't jist say he was dating someone.  Really weird.  We live in a tiny town and maybe he thought I knew her or something but she is way younger than us.  Any thoughts on this?  The guy has always been weird but this jist blows my mind.    \n","31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I hate diverticulitis I have diverticulosis. A pouch forms inside your colon and sometimes will get infected causing usually excruciating pain sometimes rivaling or exceeding that of childbirth (say the women who’ve had infections). \\n\\nI’ve only had one diagnosed infection on April 1st of this year. \\nThe disease helped me lose weight, I was headed down a path of self destruction before this happened to me. In a way I’m almost happy I got it. \\n\\nHowever.. I’ve never felt the same since. Been scared to eat. Scared of dying. Scared of going through pain that left me on the floor of the local emergency room parking lot until I mustered enough strength to walk inside bawling my eyes out of fear and pain. Still.. I’m thankful.  I survived it. I lost a hundred and fifty ish pounds. I went from 350 to about 190lbs over just a couple months. \\n\\nAll of that positivity aside, I’m sitting here contemplating going back to the hospital tonight. I have some pain, I went to the gym since my attack today and I might have gone a little too hard. I mean hell.. I lost a whole other person. I want to run and lift weights and do push ups. Push ups.. I wasn’t even able to do one when I weighed 350. Now I can do quite a few. \\nBut here I am.. in pain.. fluctuating inevitable pain. It happens often but this time it feels a little different. More on the edge of being something I can brush off and something I can’t. \\n\\n“Why am I scared to go to hospital? They help you right??”\\n\\nYeah.. they give us antibiotics that make you feel like you’re losing all sanity. Not to mention you can’t eat for quite a few days until the pain subsides. Even the you have to eat a low residue diet for weeks. A diet that took me months to get past because I was so scared of having to endure that hell again. I was bed ridden for about two weeks and scared of everything after that. I almost feel like it gave me some form of ptsd. I finally realized I could die and what would happen after that? I haven’t accomplished anything in my life. I’m 27 and a loser. No goals met, just tons of unfinished ones. Stopping when things got too hard or when I got uninspired. \\nI eat plain foods and I am a line cook. I watch my coworkers eat fantastic means while I eat hard boiled eggs.. and simple basic things. I’m tired of all of this. I want to be normal again. But I’m still happy that I’m living., and if I have to live like this forever then I will. \\nThey are surgery and the success rates are high. But that’s a whole other story of getting past the fear of being under sedation and doctors that are only human. No certainty is driving me insane. I want my life back. \\n\\nI don’t know if I should go to the ER. I don’t want to let it get worse, but I don’t want to have to take those toxic antibiotics again. But I don’t really have a choice. This all might sound incredibly dramatic and I’m sure it is. But if you’ve ever felt what I felt maybe you’d get it. It’s not the end of the world.. but it sure feels like hell for the two weeks of being on those medications. \\nDamn it.    \n","35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I can't sleep, I can't stop thinking about you For a long while now, I wasn't able to sleep. Its currently 7 am, almost 8. Today at least I managed to sleep from 12 am to 4 am. My heart hurts, I can't stop wondering when I'll be able to hear your voice again. Nightmares, ghosts from the past come and haunt me, so I can no longer rest. I only wish you were beside me and I could make you feel better, that will make me feel better too. I have so many things to tell you, so please come back. God, I start to cry when I remember your laugh. I'd like to hear it again. Genuine, pure. I've watched twice the videos you've sent me. It pains me to hear your voice yet i cant reach it, I can't talk to you, its not there. There's nothing I want more than you coming back,  I'll do my best to help you. I hope you still care about me, because i do care about you. I'm so afraid. I'm sorry I won't be able to tell this to you. I love you so much. Take care.   \n","36

the one everyone assumes your gonna mess something up..break something..yadda yadda...but it's not like I'm not a smart career woman but soon as I step out of work I'm looked as if I'm some clown that doesn't know a hole from her ass and I'm just feeling like I'm a total nothing.   \n","39

The woman to whom I have been married to for three years is amazing, to me. I still hold the same profound respect, love, affection and physical desire that I always have.\\n\\nBut over the last year, I have come to realize that I feel very strong affection for another, in addition. He is my wife's best friend and probably mine as well. He is a simply gorgeous dude with a great personality and I can't stop thinking about him.\\n\\nHe and my wife were in a relationship before I was in the picture and I have always felt that the spark had never quite died. I thin he, in particular, still holds a candle for my wife. And rather than feeling jealous or threatened, the thought really excites me. I have spoken to her about this. She says she does not have feelings for him anymore. I have not spoken to him about this at all. But I have no issue whatsoever with them engaging in whatever they might want to do. Moreover, I feel a strong physical attraction to him as well. I would have no problem with a triple arrangement. To be with both of them is the most compelling sexual fantasy my brain has ever concocted. I just don't know how to approach the subject without risking both my marriage and an extraordinary friendship.    \n","50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fuck this country I’m tired of the US. It’s clear our government doesn’t work for the people. Education is a joke, healthcare is a joke, economy is a joke. But let’s go ahead and give tax breaks to the rich while spending more on the military. Our infrastructure is failing, streets decaying, poverty is at an all time high, people are complacent, too distracted to realize they are being fucked in the ass from every direction. I have lost faith in this country and I am not proud to be an American.    \n","58  Just found out my abusive ex was cheating on me for the last few months of our relationship We broke up about a year ago, on Halloween. We had a long, but pretty abusive relationship. Should have broken up months after we started the relationship, but I was just so dependent on him and just wanted to be in a relationship because I was having such a hard time emotionally a few months prior to meeting him.\\n\\nHe started off really nice in the first few months, and typically as relationships go, you settle and find your 'true selves'. I moved to his country to be with him, but honestly I would have gone back had we broken up or not. I have a history there and go back and forth often. He had big problems with my weight at the time. While I struggled with weight for pretty much my whole life, I had a bought of depression before I met him, and ended up dropping a lot of weight. I was 5'7 120ish lbs when I met him. But that was never enough for him. He wanted me to be toned and fit. He wanted me to have abs, a nice butt, huge boobs, etc. He would always push this idea of his ideal woman onto me. Dye your brunette hair blonde. Wear workout gear every day. Don't wear Korean style clothes, wear clothes like ____ American/british instagram model (we LIVED in Korea and I like the fashion there, and even if I wanted his fashion advice, it was hard to find that style of clothes). He wanted my makeup to be thick at all times, smokey eyeliner and makeup with thick eyeliner. I could spend 30 minutes on a nice natural look with 20+ products and he would tell me \"It's not enough makeup, it doesn't even look like you are wearing any in this picture we took together!\" You have an eye infection? Don't greet me at the first floor of your apartment in your glasses, they make you look gross and ugly. He would literally look back and stare at a woman walking past us who he thought was pretty and would say very loudly \"OH WOW SHE IS SOOOO PRETTY DID YOU SEE\" which is...embarrassing to say the least. He would chat constantly with other girls, exchange selfies with them, and show them to me and say \"This is my friend ____. See how toned her legs are? Look at her legs? She's pretty. You need to be like her more\" I always thought in the back of my mind that he was cheating. Especially towards the end, when I caught him sending flirty emoticons with another girl.\\n\\nHe had told me about this girl during our relationship. They were just 'friends' among all of his other ones. I tried to be 'cool' about it, since I met a few of his female friends and they were all platonic and non romantic.\\n\\nBut I stumbled on (AKA checked up on him) his profile and although i knew he had a girlfriend, they apparently started dating two months before we even broke up. It was long distance and they didn't even meet until a year later, but still.\\n\\nWhat grates me the most is that all of the flaws he had with me were physical. Yet he was cheating on me with this girl who wore minimal makeup, isn't a fashionista, has a head of big curly red hair, obviously doesn't workout and has an average body.\\n\\nWhy did I endure two fucking years of nonstop complaining about how ugly my body was and how I wasnt a woman because I didn't look a certain way, just to be slapped in the face with this? It's not like I wasn't fucking nice to him and catered to him in every disagreement (again; about ME and how I had to look more like what HE wanted) And it's not like I was going outside with zero effort. It would take me an hour and a half to get ready with hair and makeup. \\n\\nAnd he was cheating on me WHILE HE STAYED AT MY PARENTS HOME. My poor fucking parents, who have such a big heart for people and love to welcome them into their home. He and his sister vacationed here for about a week and a half so he could visit my country. My parents redecorated and paid for all of their food. Even took a mini vacation to another city 3 hours away. Sprung for a nice hotel and everything for all of us.\\n\\nAnd he was fucking cheating on me. For a whole two months after that as well. She had to have fucking known, she just had to. I was all over his social media. He still has pictures from my neighborhood and house all over his social media.  Probably just fucking lied and said we broke up or something.\\n\\nThis was also the guy that was insecure as fuck about the fact that I had multiple sex partners before I met him. Who wouldn't let me have guy friends because \"You'd probably have sex with them\" Fuck you, fuck you and your stupid fucking lowlife self. \\n\\nI'm filled with so much hate right now. And to think that when I went to pick up my stuff at the beginning of this year, I was civil and nice to him as if it was mutual and nothing was wrong.\\n\\nNot to mention, this fucker reported me to Korean immigration for working outside of my visa range, so I've been exempt from the visa waiver program and have to have a full visa with review before i can even vacation there again. Which means I have to postpone seeing my new boyfriend until I have a job in Aug-Sept. of 2018.\\n   \n","\n","        label       Unnamed: 2 Unnamed: 3 Unnamed: 4 Unnamed: 5 Unnamed: 6  \\\n","13  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","18  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","24  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","31  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","35  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","36  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","37  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","39  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","50  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","58  self.offmychest     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","\n","   Unnamed: 7 Unnamed: 8 Unnamed: 9  \n","13     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","18     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","24     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","31     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","35     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","36     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","37     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","39     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","50     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","58     NaN        NaN        NaN     "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-3f3893d8-655c-4106-b786-521b0d238d77\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 2</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 3</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 4</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 5</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 6</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 7</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 8</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 9</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>13</th>\n","      <td>I want to have a baby so someone will love me I was raised by an abusive mother and neglectful father.

I am currently a senior in high school, but my story starts back in 6th grade.  So, I definitely feel like I need to move on, but I’m not very good with the whole change thing.  \\n\\nAnyways, in 6th grade, I met this girl who I had always kind of known through another friend, but we had just never really talked to each other.  My 6th grade class had about 20 boys and 10 girls, so all the girls pretty much became friends.  This girl lived in my neighborhood, which was great because that meant we could walk or ride our bikes to each other’s houses pretty much everyday.  \\n\\nIt didn’t take very long for us to become best friends.  We did just about everything together, even if it was just sit around on our iPods in the same room.  \\n\\nWe do not live in a very big town, so things got pretty boring being too young to drive places.  Luckily, our neighborhood is not too far from downtown, so we would occasionally ride our bikes downtown to get ice cream and hang out.  During the summers, just about every other night we were spending the night at each other’s houses, watching movies and having fun together.\\n\\nEventually, we made it to our freshman year of high school, and we were still best friends.  Little did I know that meant our friendship was quickly coming to an end...\\n\\nDuring our first semester of freshman year, we had all of the same classes except for one class at the very end of the day.  So that made me very happy because I was terrified of going to high school.  Having my best friend beside me made it a lot less scary because I knew I had someone there for me.  \\n\\nAfter the first semester of freshman year, she decided that she didn’t want to attend public school anymore.  So she decided to give homeschooling a try.  We would still hang out after I got home from school, but things just didn’t feel the same between us anymore.\\n\\nThen after her one semester of homeschooling, she decided it wasn’t her cup of tea and enrolled back into school.  Except she decided to go to a private school instead of our public school.  \\n\\nI still hadn’t really picked up on the fact that she was trying to leave me, so I would occasionally text her trying to start a conversation.  Because in my mind, she was still my best friend, and even though I didn’t see her everyday, I still wanted to talk to her.  Over time she slowly started texting me less and less, and I just eventually gave up.  \\n\\nAt her new school, she made new friends and didn’t want me anymore.  At the time, I just told myself “oh, she’s just busy with school or something” because I didn’t want to admit to myself that we weren’t friends anymore.  \\n\\nLater, I ran in to her around town a couple times, and tried to make plans to meet up with her (at this point we were juniors in high school and we both have our drivers license).  The first time, I went in to a restaurant and she happened to be working there.  She came out and gave me a hug, and said that we should hang out sometime.  So, I asked her when she got off and she told me.  Then I told her to text me when she got home, so I could come over for a little while to hang out with her.  After she got off she did text me, but she said that something came up and she had to go help her brother.  Looking back now, I realize that she didn’t really mean that she wanted to hang out with me, and she made up an excuse to get out of it.  The second time I ran into her, she gave me that fake “oh, we should catch up sometime!”  So I texted her later basically that I missed her, and I wanted to hang out with her.  This conversation ended up to me finally figuring out that when she switched schools, it was because she was tired of me (and her other friends) and wanted to make new friends.  \\n\\nI know it’s ridiculous of me to still be hung up on this one friend for so long now.  I just can’t help it, I’m not a fan of change and I like keeping my friend groups small.  All the time I spent with her, shaped so much of who I am today.  It’s heartbreaking knowing that she decided she was done being my friend, and that it didn’t take her very long to replace me.  A couple years later, and I still haven’t really found a replacement for her...\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>self.offmychest</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>24</th>\n","      <td>A terrible friend I have a crazy story to tell and would like some people to tell me what they think happened.   \\n\\nI'm a 37 year old male.  I had a best friend who I have known since Kindergarten.  We grew up at each other's house, have been pretty much inseparable our whole lives.  We live in a really small town and we have continued to be really close over the years.  I have quite a few friends and he does not. As we have gotten older, we only hung out a few times a year but would still text almost every day the last couple of years.  We talk about everything.  We have both been single for a LONG time and jist as recent as this Summer we always talked about when we would meet someone. He has never had many relationships from the opposite sex or guy friends.  \\n\\nFast foward to yesterday.  I find out he has been dating someone for two years, had a wedding over the weekend and closed on a house in another city.  WTF?!?  Why would someone do that?  I don't care about not getting a invite to the wedding as I'm not a fan of them but how can you hang out with a friend for the last 2 years and talk about hoping to meet someone and you have a GF the whole time?!?   The weird part is he still texts me to this day asking me \"If I saw the game last night\" etc.. while he is married, living in a new house and doesn't say anything.  \\n\\nObviously some will say he wasn't that great of a friend to begin with and probably so.  That still doesn't explain why for 2 years he didn't jist say he was dating someone.  Really weird.  We live in a tiny town and maybe he thought I knew her or something but she is way younger than us.  Any thoughts on this?

In a way I’m almost happy I got it. \\n\\nHowever.. I’ve never felt the same since. Been scared to eat. Scared of dying. Scared of going through pain that left me on the floor of the local emergency room parking lot until I mustered enough strength to walk inside bawling my eyes out of fear and pain. Still.. I’m thankful.  I survived it. I lost a hundred and fifty ish pounds. I went from 350 to about 190lbs over just a couple months. \\n\\nAll of that positivity aside, I’m sitting here contemplating going back to the hospital tonight. I have some pain, I went to the gym since my attack today and I might have gone a little too hard. I mean hell.. I lost a whole other person. I want to run and lift weights and do push ups. Push ups.. I wasn’t even able to do one when I weighed 350. Now I can do quite a few. \\nBut here I am.. in pain.. fluctuating inevitable pain. It happens often but this time it feels a little different. More on the edge of being something I can brush off and something I can’t. \\n\\n“Why am I scared to go to hospital? They help you right??”\\n\\nYeah.. they give us antibiotics that make you feel like you’re losing all sanity. Not to mention you can’t eat for quite a few days until the pain subsides. Even the you have to eat a low residue diet for weeks. A diet that took me months to get past because I was so scared of having to endure that hell again. I was bed ridden for about two weeks and scared of everything after that. I almost feel like it gave me some form of ptsd. I finally realized I could die and what would happen after that? I haven’t accomplished anything in my life. I’m 27 and a loser. No goals met, just tons of unfinished ones. Stopping when things got too hard or when I got uninspired. \\nI eat plain foods and I am a line cook. I watch my coworkers eat fantastic means while I eat hard boiled eggs.. and simple basic things. I’m tired of all of this. I want to be normal again. But I’m still happy that I’m living., and if I have to live like this forever then I will. \\nThey are surgery and the success rates are high. But that’s a whole other story of getting past the fear of being under sedation and doctors that are only human. No certainty is driving me insane. I want my life back. \\n\\nI don’t know if I should go to the ER. I don’t want to let it get worse, but I don’t want to have to take those toxic antibiotics again. But I don’t really have a choice. This all might sound incredibly dramatic and I’m sure it is. But if you’ve ever felt what I felt maybe you’d get it. It’s not the end of the world.. but it sure feels like hell for the two weeks of being on those medications. \\nDamn it.</td>\n","      <td>self.offmychest</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>35</th>\n","      <td>I can't sleep, I can't stop thinking about you For a long while now, I wasn't able to sleep.

While I struggled with weight for pretty much my whole life, I had a bought of depression before I met him, and ended up dropping a lot of weight. I was 5'7 120ish lbs when I met him.

Which means I have to postpone seeing my new boyfriend until I have a job in Aug-Sept. of 2018.\\n</td>\n","      <td>self.offmychest</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-3f3893d8-655c-4106-b786-521b0d238d77')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-3f3893d8-655c-4106-b786-521b0d238d77 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

All this occurred over the space of decades.\\n\\nOnce I fucked up bad with alcohol and methadone. I ended up in the ICU. The doctor told me that a large number of bipolar people have addiction problems.\\n\\nNow I take my meds exactly as prescribed and the only other drug I use is marijuana, which is not a problem. \\n\\nAre there others of you that have had any similar problems?   \n","2  Wanted to share some revelations I just had tonight about depression...for the first time in over a year I have hope that things can get better. Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.    \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I feel deader than dead. I find that I don't have real \"wants\" anymore. There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I'm pretty sure my friends suicidal what do I do? My best friends girlfriend left him over something stupid and embarrassing that he did a while back.Anyways I'm pretty sure it's that, he's always saying how he wants to go to an island all alone with no one who loves him. He's told me before that he has depression but never said that he's suicidal. I asked him about it and he firmly denied it. He's always saying really self hating stuff all the time like \"I'm just a little emo prick\" or \"I'm such a depressed little bitch\" Idk what to do.Help.   \n","\n","        label        Unnamed: 2 Unnamed: 3 Unnamed: 4 Unnamed: 5 Unnamed: 6  \\\n","0       self.Anxiety     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","1       self.bipolar     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","2    self.depression     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","3  self.SuicideWatch     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","4  self.SuicideWatch     NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN        NaN      \n","\n","  Unnamed: 7 Unnamed: 8 Unnamed: 9  \n","0     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","1     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","2     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","3     NaN        NaN        NaN     \n","4     NaN        NaN        NaN     "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-223bd81a-72f2-429c-9a50-d8dcb7fe961f\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 2</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 3</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 4</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 5</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 6</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 7</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 8</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 9</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>wanting to skip or postpone my exam my exam is on saturday and i feel a massive urge to reschedule\\n\\ni experience this often with major exams. *flashbacks to several years prior where i skipped all of my final exams and failed* \\n\\ni just dont feel ready i dont know im so tired and mentallly fried that i feel a few days might help. but a part of me thinks i should fight this urge and just tank it</td>\n","      <td>self.Anxiety</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Do other bipolar folks have problems with substance abuse?

Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.</td>\n","      <td>self.depression</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>I feel deader than dead. I find that I don't have real \"wants\" anymore. There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.</td>\n","      <td>self.SuicideWatch</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>I'm pretty sure my friends suicidal what do I do?

All this occurred over the space of decades.\\n\\nOnce I fucked up bad with alcohol and methadone. I ended up in the ICU. The doctor told me that a large number of bipolar people have addiction problems.\\n\\nNow I take my meds exactly as prescribed and the only other drug I use is marijuana, which is not a problem. \\n\\nAre there others of you that have had any similar problems?   \n","2  Wanted to share some revelations I just had tonight about depression...for the first time in over a year I have hope that things can get better. Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.    \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I feel deader than dead. I find that I don't have real \"wants\" anymore. There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I'm pretty sure my friends suicidal what do I do? My best friends girlfriend left him over something stupid and embarrassing that he did a while back.Anyways I'm pretty sure it's that, he's always saying how he wants to go to an island all alone with no one who loves him. He's told me before that he has depression but never said that he's suicidal. I asked him about it and he firmly denied it. He's always saying really self hating stuff all the time like \"I'm just a little emo prick\" or \"I'm such a depressed little bitch\" Idk what to do.Help.   \n","5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Self-harm urges are getting stronger Hey everyone. Dealing with a really rough situation, so I thought I'd share it here. \\n\\nMy mental state has gradually been getting worse for quite some time. While it started off with stronger elements of anxiety, depression has come as a byproduct of the self-isolation and self-sabotage caused by anxiety. \\n\\nI've never self harmed before, and I haven't had urges for all that long. Recently though the urges have gotten very strong. Ive been punching myself in the head whenever I have an aggressively negative thought about myself and no one else is around. If my brother hadn't come home early today I probably would have cut myself. The only thing holding me back is fear that my family will find out, and fear of getting caught in the act. \\n\\nI am going through an extra stressful time right now, as I have an exam in a couple of days. That's definitely contributing, so I'm hoping things will get a little better once that's done. Unfortunately I have no motivation, as I feel like my degree is pointless and I have no interest in the subject, but also intense anxiety because I'm incredibly afraid of my family's reaction if I fail. The result is a complete inability to keep focussed, and intense feelings of self-hatred. \\n\\nI do fear that even when I do get past my exam, my mental state will continue to get gradually worse. Unless something does change, I believe I will end up self-harming eventually. I'm too anxious and low on self-confidence to change anything myself though, so I guess I'll just see where this takes me. \\n\\nSorry for the long post. If you have any advice, or just some support, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I don't remember ever really being happy. I've been content but that's the extent of it. Some days I feel like I'm wading through endless thoughts of self hate. Some days its so bad that I feel like I'm drowning in it and I can't figure out how to make it stop. My roommates offer no help, stating they suffer from depression too. When I confided in my parents that not a day goes by that I don't fantasize about killing myself, I was told \"Oh you should probably get therapy.\" and that was it. I would go to therapy and take medication, if I had insurance. I constantly feel like I can't do anything right and that every person I come in contact with is criticizing me. Most days, after I get off work, I'll lay in bed and hardly get up. The only reasons I'll even get up is to get food or use the bathroom. My roommates still expect me to act a certain way, to want to go out, to want to talk. They both claim to have depression, and maybe they do, but they aren't supportive in the slightest. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't feel like talking helps anymore.   \n","8

Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>I feel deader than dead. I find that I don't have real \"wants\" anymore. There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>I'm pretty sure my friends suicidal what do I do?

He's always saying really self hating stuff all the time like \"I'm just a little emo prick\" or \"I'm such a depressed little bitch\" Idk what to do.Help.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>Self-harm urges are getting stronger Hey everyone. Dealing with a really rough situation, so I thought I'd share it here. \\n\\nMy mental state has gradually been getting worse for quite some time. While it started off with stronger elements of anxiety, depression has come as a byproduct of the self-isolation and self-sabotage caused by anxiety. \\n\\nI've never self harmed before, and I haven't had urges for all that long. Recently though the urges have gotten very strong. Ive been punching myself in the head whenever I have an aggressively negative thought about myself and no one else is around. If my brother hadn't come home early today I probably would have cut myself. The only thing holding me back is fear that my family will find out, and fear of getting caught in the act. \\n\\nI am going through an extra stressful time right now, as I have an exam in a couple of days. That's definitely contributing, so I'm hoping things will get a little better once that's done. Unfortunately I have no motivation, as I feel like my degree is pointless and I have no interest in the subject, but also intense anxiety because I'm incredibly afraid of my family's reaction if I fail. The result is a complete inability to keep focussed, and intense feelings of self-hatred. \\n\\nI do fear that even when I do get past my exam, my mental state will continue to get gradually worse. Unless something does change, I believe I will end up self-harming eventually. I'm too anxious and low on self-confidence to change anything myself though, so I guess I'll just see where this takes me. \\n\\nSorry for the long post. If you have any advice, or just some support, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I don't remember ever really being happy. I've been content but that's the extent of it. Some days I feel like I'm wading through endless thoughts of self hate. Some days its so bad that I feel like I'm drowning in it and I can't figure out how to make it stop. My roommates offer no help, stating they suffer from depression too. When I confided in my parents that not a day goes by that I don't fantasize about killing myself, I was told \"Oh you should probably get therapy.\" and that was it. I would go to therapy and take medication, if I had insurance. I constantly feel like I can't do anything right and that every person I come in contact with is criticizing me. Most days, after I get off work, I'll lay in bed and hardly get up. The only reasons I'll even get up is to get food or use the bathroom. My roommates still expect me to act a certain way, to want to go out, to want to talk. They both claim to have depression, and maybe they do, but they aren't supportive in the slightest.
